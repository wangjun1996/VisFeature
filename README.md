# VisFeature
A stand-alone program for features extraction and visualization of biological sequences

## Installation

We have tested these codes on **Windows10-64bit platform**. There is no guarantee that these codes can be compiled and executed on other platforms without modifications.

For ***Microsoft Windows platform***, just download the VisFeature-win32-x64.7z package from https://github.com/wangjun1996/VisFeature/releases. Unpack it to your favorite location and then open `VisFeature.exe`.

For ***Linux platform***, just download the VisFeature-linux-x64.7z package from https://github.com/wangjun1996/VisFeature/releases. Unpack it to your favorite location and then open `VisFeature`.

**Please note**: The maximum size of file that can be opened in VisFeature is **5MB**. If you want to use a file that larger than 5MB as input, you can **upload** it on the page of "Compute And Visualization" mode. Uploading file is much faster than opening file, so upload is more recommended.

If you got any difficulties, just send emails to wj0708@tju.edu.cn. We will try our best to fix it.

## Development
If you want to run these codes in the development environment, you should install **Node.js** first. Please go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ download **Node.js** environment and install that on your machine.

After your **Node.js** environment is ready, find out the location of VisFeature that you unpack and enter this directory. Then type and execute the command: `"npm start"`. After a few seconds, VisFeature will start.
